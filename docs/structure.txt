Structure
  i need to parse the profiles and extract emails
  i need to keep track of which followers ive seen and which followers i havent seen
  which is why im keeping good state management and using redux

  thought process
  start with a profile that doesnt have a lot of followers that way i can test my code on a smaller profile
